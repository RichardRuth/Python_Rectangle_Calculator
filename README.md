# Python_Rectangle_Calculator

This Python program was created for a Python programming class at Santa Fe College as part of my coursework undertaken to update my programming and development skills.

This program explored OOP concepts in Python including classes and instances.  It accepts user input for the height and width of a rectangle, then creates an instance of the Rectangle class called UserRectangle, to compute the rectangle's area and perimeter. Finally, the rectangle is drawn on the user's screen with the appropriate height and width.

This program passed all assigned rules and tests, and received a grade of 100%.
